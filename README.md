# Loan Portfolio Quality Prediction Model ( Project completed on October 2020 )

I developed a machine learning model that accurately predicts loan portfolio quality for a non-banking financial company (NBFC), resulting in a significant reduction in losses. I designed and executed deep data diving initiatives to examine relationships between variables, identifying key factors that impact loan portfolio quality. Using this information, I developed a machine learning model that accurately predicts portfolio quality based on a range of variables.

Objective:
The primary objective of this project was to develop a model that accurately predicts loan portfolio quality, allowing the NBFC to make informed decisions about loan approvals and minimize potential losses.
Approach

To achieve this objective, I designed and executed deep data diving initiatives to examine relationships between variables, identifying key factors that impact loan portfolio quality. Using this information, I developed a machine learning model that accurately predicts portfolio quality based on a range of variables.
