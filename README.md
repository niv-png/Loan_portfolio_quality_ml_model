#Loan Portfolio Quality Prediction Model

I developed a machine learning model that accurately predicts loan portfolio quality for a non-banking financial company (NBFC), resulting in a significant reduction in losses. I designed and executed deep data diving initiatives to examine relationships between variables, identifying key factors that impact loan portfolio quality. Using this information, I developed a machine learning model that accurately predicts portfolio quality based on a range of variables.
Objective

The primary objective of this project was to develop a model that accurately predicts loan portfolio quality, allowing the NBFC to make informed decisions about loan approvals and minimize potential losses.
Approach

To achieve this objective, I designed and executed deep data diving initiatives to examine relationships between variables, identifying key factors that impact loan portfolio quality. Using this information, I developed a machine learning model that accurately predicts portfolio quality based on a range of variables.
Results

My model successfully reduced NBFC losses by 60% by accurately predicting portfolio quality and enabling more informed decision-making. Additionally, I increased the predictive accuracy of the model by 30% through deep data diving initiatives.
